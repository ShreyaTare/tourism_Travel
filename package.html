                        <img src="resources/images/spiritual1.jpg" alt="Featured tour 1">
                        <p>Jakhu Temple (also Jakhoo Temple) is an ancient temple in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India, dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman.[1] It is situated on Jakhu Hill, Shimla's highest peak, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) east of the Ridge at a height of 2,455 m (8,054 ft) above sea level.[2] Each year, a festival is held on Dussehra, before 1972 the festival used to be held at Annadale.[3] Shri Hanuman Jakhu is a statue situated in the temple premises which is one of the tallest in the world.[4]

                          According to the Ramayana, Hanuman stopped at the location to rest while searching for the Sanjivni Booti to revive Lakshmana. A giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010. At 108 feet (33 m), it surpasses the statue of Christ the Redeemer, which measures at 98 feet (30 m), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The cost of construction was Rs 1.5 crores. The public unveiling was officiated by Abhishek Bachchan.</p>
